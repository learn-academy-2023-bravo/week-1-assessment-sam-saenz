# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement in Javascript checks a given statement for a boolean return, and then executes a block of code if the return is true. You can also use else to execute a different block of code if a condition is false.

Researched answer: 

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a software that was created to allow developers to share code freely between eachother. Github is a service that acts as an interface for git, making it easier to use.

Researched answer: Git is a version control software that was originally designed to make coordination in coding tasks easier, and has since been used moreso to keep track of changes made to codebases or files in general. Github is a git repository, based on the web and using cloud storage, that acts as an easier way to use git and adds its own user features that make git collaboration better for coders.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The Boolean operators return boolean values. These are the operators like and, or, and not. They are often used to check if a statement is true or false within if/else statements.

Researched answer: Boolean operators are also very useful for creating complex logic within code, and are a sort of building block in that sense. They can be used to create complicated decision trees and are present in almost every form of logical code.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is a position in a structure, for example an array. Because javascript uses a zero index, the thing stored in the first position will be index 0, the next will be 1, and so on. A value is a piece of information that is stored to be used, and can be anything, without an order.

Researched answer: An index is a type of value, specifically used to keep track of positions of data within a collection. This means that when using any data structure that has an ordered set of values, you are innately using an index for each. A value can be a wider range of data, including built-in uses like the index of an array, or the data input and stored by a user.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and strings are similar in that they hold an ordered series of values. In strings, these values are always a single character. In arrays these values can be many data types, including strings themselves, so they are more commonly used for storage of other values while a string is often itself the data you want stored.

Researched answer: The main diiference between Arrays and Strings are that one, the string, is a data type that is comprised of characters, and an array is a data structure used to hold a collection of data. An array can hold many elements of the same type, though they are not limited to a single form of data like strings. They are similar in that they can both be manipulated in similar ways, and strings can even be easily represented by an array of characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: In pair programing you have a Driver and a Navigator. The driver is responsible for directly interacting with the code that is being worked on, while the navigator watches. Ideally, they will both contribute to the code, with the navigator referring to documentation and walking the driver through things they need help with. Also, the roles are switched, potentially many times, over the course of a pair programming session to give both people experience in both roles.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a form of agile development, which involves breaking large problems down into smaller ones. It uses a Driver and Navigator, where the driver operates the machine with the code, and the navigator focuses on maintaing direction and moving toward the overall goal. Both partners will spend equal time in each position.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that either takes in or returns other functions.

2. Jest: Jest is a framework made for javascript with the express purpose of testing code and ensuring continuity in a codebase.

3. Objects: An object is a user-defined entity with user-defined traits or properties, like id numbers or names.

4. Method: Methods are actions to be used on objects, often to extract trait information of an object instance. For example, it can return a single trait of an object, or take one or more traits and perform an operation on them to get a new result or new data.

5. Classes: Classes are a special type of function used to define the template for an object. They also have a name and assigned traits.
